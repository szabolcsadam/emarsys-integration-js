# emarsys-integration-js

Emarsys Integration JS (SIJS) is an API providing methods of communication between Emarsys and integrated services running in an iframe. One can send post messages out of the iframe and SIJS will handle those requests if there is a handler for.

__General message format__

```
{
  "event": "handler",
  "data": {
    "some_key": "data"
   },
  "source": {
    "integration_id": "some_integration",
    "integration_instance_id": "iframe's random id"
  }
}
```

__Fields__

|Field|Role|Mandatory|
|-----|----|---------|
|event|Name of the handler to pass the message to.|YES|
|some_key|Arbitrary data the handler needs to work properly.|
|source|This is a signature marking where the message came from. Every integration has an ID (eg. content-editor) and every integration iframe instance has an instance ID (a sufficiently large random number, actually).     Though not all message handlers do rely on _source_, it is best to always include it in your message.|MIXED|

# Message handlers available

# Functions available

## getFullUrlByTarget

Get URL by target (same targets available as in navigate message handler), useful for links.

```javascript
window.Emarsys.integration.getFullUrlByTarget({
  target: 'me_push/edit',
  params: {
    id: 318
  }
})
```

## navigate

Redirect to target (same targets available as in navigate message handler).

```javascript
window.Emarsys.integration.navigate({
  target: 'me_push/edit',
  params: {
    id: 318
  }
})
```

# Development

If you would like to make local changes, you need to run `gulp start`. You can reach the resulting code [on this local URL then](http://localhost:1235/integration.js).

## Running tests

If you want to run the tests on your machine you can do by executing one of the following commands:
```bash
gulp test
npm test
```

If you don't have gulp on your machine you can install by executing the following command:
```bash
npm i -g gulp
```

# Deployment

Code is automatically built and deployed whenever there is a new changeset in following branches:

|Changes to branch|Go live on environment|
|-----------------|----------------------|
|master|staging|
|production|production|

So you can push your changes into the master branch, and Codeship will deploy it to the staging environment. Also you can merge your changes to the master branch, and it will be deployed to production by Codeship:

```bash
git pull origin master; git push origin master; git push origin master:production
```
